##Organization

**/app** - Core application, sets up the express server and starts up all the various controllers.  This single backend application creates functionality for multiple font end Javascript applications.
 
**/app/controllers** - Endpoints, public API, all of the URL mapping for REST like communication happens here.  Most of these are pretty thin and pass the work to the related library.
  
**/app/lib** - backend libraries and utilities.  These do not have any endpoints themselves, but many have a corresponding controller to handle public communication.
  
**/app/models** - Mongoose models and schema. Mongo is not queried directly, all database transactions go through Mongoose models.
  
**/app/views & /app/templates** - Handlebars backend templated views and templates.  Sparsely used as much of the templating and views are managed by the JS applications.

**/app/public/scripts/apps/** - Base directory for front end JS applications.
